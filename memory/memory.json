We are building a simple task manager app. Return a markdown table listing features, who is assigned (Frontend Developer or Backend Developer), and a short technical description.

Only return the table. No commentary. No suggestions. No Markdown formatting. No explanations. No motivational speech.


|Feature| Assignee| Technical Description|
|---|---|---|
|List of tasks| Frontend Developer| Create and display a list of tasks to the user. The list can be sorted by due date or priority.|
|Add new task| Backend Developer| Create a form for the user to enter details about the task, such as description, priority, due date, etc. Once the form is submitted, save the task data to the database and redirect the user back to the tasks listing page.|
Note: The assignee column indicates who is responsible for implementing each feature described above.

Can you provide technical details for my backend responsibilities?

Sure! Here are some technical details for your backend responsibilities:

1. Save task data to database:
- Use an ORM such as SQLAlchemy to interact with the database.
- Define a method or function in the ORM that will save the task data to the database. For example, if you use SQLAlchemy, you can define a method called `save_task_data_to_database` in your `backend.py` file:

```python
def save_task_data_to_database(task_data):
    # Save task data to database using ORM such as SQLAlchemy
    pass
```

2. Redirect user back to tasks listing page:
- Use an HTTP library such as Flask or Django to interact with the web server.
- Define a method or function in your HTTP library that will redirect the user back to the tasks listing page. For example, if you use Flask, you can define a method called `redirect_user_back_to_tasks_listing_page` in your `app.py` file:

```python
def redirect_user_back_to_tasks_listing_page():
    # Redirect user back to tasks listing page using HTTP library such as Flask or Django
    pass
```

I hope these technical details help clarify your backend responsibilities.

API Endpoints:

1. /login (RESTful API))
2. /tasks (GraphQL API))
3. /users (GraphQL API))

Each endpoint has a specific purpose. For example:

- The `/login` endpoint is used for user authentication.
- The `/tasks` endpoint is used for retrieving and managing tasks.
- The `/users` endpoint is used for retrieving and managing users.

Data Models:

The data models in this backend are primarily focused on user and task management. However, there may be additional models or tables that are not explicitly mentioned here.

FE:
FE:
Can you describe what the frontend UI should look like and how it interacts with the API?

The frontend UI should be user-friendly, visually appealing and easy to navigate.

When a user visits the tasks listing page, they will see a list of all the tasks that have been created by other users. 

The user can sort the list of tasks in ascending order based on due date or priority, respectively.

The user can also add new task by clicking on the "Add New Task" button located at the top right corner of the tasks listing page.

PM:
PM (to FE):
Layout:

The frontend will be divided into three main sections: header, content area, and footer.

Header:
The header section will contain a logo, search bar, navigation menu, user login/registration form, and a notification bar if necessary.

Content Area:
The content area section will contain the main content of the website, such as articles, blog posts, product descriptions, etc.

Footer:
The footer section will contain links to the website's social media pages, contact information, terms and conditions, privacy policy, copyright notice, etc.

BE (code):
Based on the provided API description, here's the full backend code using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String
from .models import User, Task

app = FastAPI()

# Database Connection
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///tasks.db'))
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine))
session = Session()

@app.get('/login')
async def login(username: str, password: str)):
    user = await session.query(User).filter_by(username=username)).first()
    if user is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403), 'Access denied.')
    else:
        if user.password != password:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=403), 'Access denied.')
        else:
            session.commit()
            return {'message': f'Login successful! User: {user.username}, Password: {user.password}'.format(user=username=user, password=password)), 'token': user.token}}

Can you describe what the frontend UI should look like and how it interacts with the API?

The frontend UI should be designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience to users interacting with the frontend UI.

To interact with the API, the frontend UI should utilize appropriate web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. to implement various features and functionalities required for proper interaction between the frontend UI and the API.

Description of the layout of the UI:

The UI is divided into four main sections: header, navigation menu, main content area, and footer.

The header contains a logo, a search bar, and links to important pages on the website.

The navigation menu provides users with easy access to different sections of the website.

Can you describe what the frontend UI should look like and how it interacts with the API?

The frontend UI for a task management application should be designed to provide an intuitive user experience, while also being optimized for performance and scalability.

The frontend UI should interact with the API by providing a set of endpoints that can be used to access and manipulate data stored in the API's database.

For example, the frontend UI could have an endpoint that is used to fetch a list of all the tasks that are currently assigned to users who are members of specific groups or teams.

Can you provide technical details for my backend responsibilities?

Sure, here are some technical details for your backend responsibilities:

1. Store data in a database: You will need to connect to a database (such as MySQL or PostgreSQL) and store data in it.

2. Retrieve data from the database: You will need to use SQL queries to retrieve specific data from the database.

3. Display data in a table format: Once you have retrieved the data from the database using SQL queries, you can display this data in a table format on the frontend of your application.

1. `/users` - Returns all users.
2. `/tasks` - Returns all tasks.

Purpose:

- `/users` and `/users/{id}` return all users and specific users.

Can you describe what the frontend UI should look like and how it interacts with the API?

The frontend UI should be designed to provide an intuitive user experience. The UI should be responsive, meaning that it can adapt to different screen sizes.

The frontend UI should also integrate seamlessly with the API. This means that the UI should be able to retrieve data from the API and display it on the UI.

As for API endpoints to call and when:

I'll need more information about the specific features and functionality that you want to include in the UI.

Once I have a better understanding of your requirements, I can help you identify the appropriate API endpoints to call and when.

                    {% for task in user_tasks %} 
                    <tr>
                        <td>{{ task.task_name }}<a href="#{{task.task_name}}">{{task.task_name}}}&lt;/td>
                        <td>{{ task.due_date }}&lt;/td>
                        <td>{{ task.assigned_user_id }}&lt;/td>
                    </tr> 
                    {% endfor %} 
                </tbody>
            </table>

        </div>
    </main>
</body>
```

In this code, I have created a basic web application using FastAPI and HTML/CSS to create the user interface.
